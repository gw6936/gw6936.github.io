Here's something cool that I found:
Regular expressions extract information from text by searching for matches of a specific pattern, and I will be exploring the findall() tool today! This function finds all of the matches and returns them as a list of strings that each represents one match. Here is a basic example to find different matches, looking at a string of "abc aab ab acb cab c".

```{python}
import re
x="abc aab ab acb cab c"
#this grabs all instances
re.findall(r"a.",x)

import re
x="abc aab ab acb cab c"
#this grabs matches with 1 or more "a"s
re.findall(r"a+",x)

import re
x="abc aab ab acb cab c"
#this grabs instances where there are two "a"s together
re.findall(r"a{2}",x)

import re
x="abc aab ab acb cab c"
#this grabs instances that begin with an "a" and have two letters after
re.findall(r"a..\s",x)
```

Did you also know that Python and R can communicate?! This really blew my mind.
By using a handy package called reticulate, R can talk.. and so can Python!
Here is R talking...
```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
Rtalk <- "'Hello, this is R speaking!'"
```
... and here is Python responding!
```{python}
#Python code chunk
Ptalk="'Hi R, this is Python. Nice to meet you!'"
print(r.Rtalk, Ptalk)
```
Ta-dah! Even though R and Python speak different languages, through the reticulate package, they can communicate beautifully!
